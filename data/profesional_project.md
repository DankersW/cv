## Verification platform
Title: Verification platform
For: Connectivity department, Volvo Group
Technology: Kafka, RPC, Python, Micro-services, Docker, CI/CD
Text: Redesigned how Bitbucket events trigger Jenkins jobs, and how the CI-CD chain is build-up. Kafka was used as message queue between several created Dockerized micro services written in Python. These micro-services were spread out over the Volvo network and managed via Docker-Swarm. I designed the system from a conceptional idea to a product that is running 24/7.
