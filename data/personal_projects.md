My biggest and longest running private project, I started the project in 2020 abd work on it in my spare time. The project is used to learn new languages, software engineering concepts, patterns, practice running long projects and most of all for fun.

The project is running in my home monitoring the house and garden, as well as giving some control to my family.

Currently of writing, the system includes:

* A battery powered wireless sensor network that receives information (temperature, humidity, soil humidity (plants), light, air quality, door and window status, etc) and saves it for monitoring and visualization. This includes custom make micro-controlers and gateway electronics design.
* A PoC which makes it possible to voice contol the system using my Google home-assistant enabled internet speakers.
* CI/CD pipelines that deploys the updates micro-services automatically to my Kubernetes cluster.
* Web page for monitoring the house.
* A Flutter based smart-mirror that shows the departure times of the nearst busses and trams, the families todo list, predicted and current weather, etc.
* A system to create and automate different scenes using lighting and blinds
