## Vinnter

### Weldings-ystem Gateway
Title: Gateway for different welding machines
For: Esab, contractor via Vinnter AB
Technology: Micro-services, Go, Python, C++, gRPC
Text: Maintaining and developing of linux based gateway application with a microservices architecture running on a Single-board computer, the micro-services communicate using gRPC. Languages of the services range from Go, C++, Python, and JS (Vue). The gateway is part of a bigger system and communicates with other nodes in the system via HTTP. I created and maintained serval application and serivces, all the services I created were written in Go. Our architecture supported different (gateway) platforms/hardware aswell as different welding-systems and configurations.

### Presence detection radar
Title: PoC precence and fall detection using radar
For: Esab, contractor via Vinnter AB
Technology: AWS, Python, Data-visualization, REST
Text: Small PoC project to verify if a radar system could be used to track the usuage of a welding booth. The radar system and detection algorithmes was provided by a supplier. My task included creating webhooks for our clouds to communicate as well as an monitoring tool to visualize the received data.

### BLE Sensors Firmware
Title: BLE wireless termostat system
For: In-house project, Vinnter AB
Technology: BLE, Wireless, HIL, C, Embedded, NRF52840, Python, CI/CD
Text: Worked on an inhouse project where we build a wireless termostat system for floor heating. The product was developt 100% inhouse ranging from electronics and platics, to software. I joined the project in a later stage. My main contributions to the project was were that I developt a HIL and SIL (Hardware and Software In The Loop) system to run big system test on multible targets (communicating wirelessly with eachother) as well as preformace tests on single targets. Some custom hardware was also developt to achieve this goal. The tests where automatically triggered via CI/CD pipelines.

## Volvo

### Verification platform
Title: Verification platform
For: Connectivity department, Volvo Group
Technology: Kafka, RPC, Python, Micro-services, Docker, CI/CD
Text: Redesigned how Bitbucket events trigger Jenkins jobs, and how the CI-CD chain is build-up. Kafka was used as message queue between several created Dockerized micro services written in Python. These micro-services were spread out over the Volvo network and managed via Docker-Swarm. I designed the system from a conceptional idea to a product that is running 24/7.

### Dev-ops Engineer
Title: dev-ops engineer
For: Connectivity department, Volvo Group
Technology: Jenkins, Python, Docker
Text: Created and maintained several CI-CD freestyle Jenkins jobs (Python) as part of the CI team responsible for the telematics gateway. I joined the CI team as a borrowed rescource

### Data logging system
Title: Data logging system
For: Autonomous Vehicles, Volvo Group
Technology: Embedded-liux, C++, logging, Yocto, QT
Text: Prototyped and developed (C++) a data logging system for autonomous and concept vehicles. Including hardware selection, embedded software, design of an on- and offboard QUI, data storage, as well as remote controlling of the logging unit.

### Scrum master
Title: Scrum master
For: Autonomous Vehicles, Volvo Group
Technology: Agile, Scrum, SAFe
Text: I was the Scrum master & developer in a team of 4 people. We worked on the agile release train that created the first commercial autonomous transportation solution.

### Communication infrastructure for autonomous drivinger
Title: Communication infrastructure for autonomous driving
For: Autonomous Vehicles, Volvo Group
Technology: 
Text: Investigating the requirements, selection of hardware and technologies, as well as on-site measurements. Later on I became the element owner of the wireless communication infrastructure at the project site.

### Research projects

Technology: C-ITS, Smart cities, C++
Text: Software Developer on varies public funded research projects with a focus on C-ITS.

### Master thesis
Title: Master thesis
For: Connectivity department, Volvo Group
Technology: C-ITS, Smart cities, C++
Text: Software Developer on varies public funded research projects with a focus on C-ITS.
