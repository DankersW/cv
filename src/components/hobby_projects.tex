My biggest and longest running private project, I started the project in 2020 and work on it in my spare time. The project is used to learn new languages, software engineering concepts, patterns, practice running long projects and most of all for fun. \\

The project is running in my home, monitoring the house and garden, as well as giving some control possibilities to my family. All the source code is publicly availed on my GitHub page \\

    \item Web page for monitoring 
    \item A Flutter-based smart-mirror that shows the departure times of the nearest buses and trams, the families to-do list, predicted and current weather, etc.

\CVItem{Woodworking} \\
At home, I have made several wooden furniture and build-ins where design and functionality are one of the main key points. This is done to maximize the available space to the fullest. I design the pieces using 3D modeling software (sketch-up) \\
Some projects I made are a storage bed, coffee-table, outdoor furniture, build-in closets, bench, and store shelfs
