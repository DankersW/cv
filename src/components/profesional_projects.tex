\textbf{Welding system IoT Gateway:} Consultant at Esab. Maintaining and developing Linux based gateway application with a microservices architecture running on a Single-board computer, the micro-services communicate using gRPC. Languages of the services ranged from Go, C++, Python, and JS (Vue). The gateway is part of a bigger system and communicates with other nodes in the system via HTTP. I created and maintained serval applications and services, all the services I created were written in Go. Our architecture supported different (gateway) platforms/hardware as well as different welding systems and configurations.

\textbf{Radar presence detection:} Small PoC project to verify if a radar system could be used to track the usage of a welding booth. The radar system and detection algorithms were provided by a supplier. My task included creating webhooks for our clouds to communicate as well as a monitoring tool to visualize the received data.

\textbf{BLE Sensor network firmware development:} Worked on an in-house project where we build a wireless thermostat system for floor heating. The product was FULLY developed In-house ranging from electronics and plastics to software. I joined the project at a later stage. My main contributions to the project were that I developed a HIL and SIL (Hardware and Software in the Loop) system to run big system tests on multiple targets (communicating wirelessly with each other) as well as performance tests on single targets. Some custom hardware was also developed to achieve this goal. The tests were automatically triggered via CI/CD pipelines. \\

\textbf{Verification platform:} Redesigned how Bitbucket events trigger Jenkins jobs, and how the CI-CD chain is build-up. Kafka was used as message queue between several created Dockerized micro services written in Python that were spread out over the Volvo network. I designed the system from a conceptional idea to a production ready implementation. The project is used by the verification department of the Connectivity Group.
