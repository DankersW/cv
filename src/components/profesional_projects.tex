\textbf{Weldings-system Gateway:} Consulant at Esab. Maintaining and developing of linux based gateway application with a microservices architecture running on a Single-board computer, the micro-services communicate using gRPC. Languages of the services range from Go, C++, Python, and JS (Vue). The gateway is part of a bigger system and communicates with other nodes in the system via HTTP. I created and maintained serval application and serivces, all the services I created were written in Go. Our architecture supported different (gateway) platforms/hardware aswell as different welding-systems and configurations.

\textbf{Radar presence detection:} Small PoC project to verify if a radar system could be used to track the usuage of a welding booth. The radar system and detection algorithmes was provided by a supplier. My task included creating webhooks for our clouds to communicate as well as an monitoring tool to visualize the received data.

\textbf{BLE Sensor network firmware development:} Worked on an inhouse project where we build a wireless termostat system for floor heating. The product was developt 100\% inhouse ranging from electronics and platics, to software. I joined the project in a later stage. My main contributions to the project was were that I developt a HIL and SIL (Hardware and Software In The Loop) system to run big system test on multible targets (communicating wirelessly with eachother) as well as preformace tests on single targets. Some custom hardware was also developt to achieve this goal. The tests where automatically triggered via CI/CD pipelines. \\

\textbf{Verification platform:} Redesigned how Bitbucket events trigger Jenkins jobs, and how the CI-CD chain is build-up. Kafka was used as message queue between several created Dockerized micro services written in Python that were spread out over the Volvo network. I designed the system from a conceptional idea to a production ready implementation. The project is used by the verification department of the Connectivity Group.
