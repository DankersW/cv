% Personal projects
\CVSection{Hobby projects}
\CVItem{Home automation} \\
\emph{Topics: Google cloud platform, ESP32, IoT, Python, Monitoring} \\
Self developed home automation kit that runs on a local server as well as in the cloud. The cloud service is mostly used for natural language processing (voice commands using Google Assistant) and an integration with the Sonos ecosystem. The home server serves as a device gateway, storage facility, and as a monitoring unit in the form of a web-server.

\CVSection{Work achievements}
\CVItem{Volvo Group}

\SmallSep
\textbf{Verification platform:} Redesigned how Bitbucket events trigger Jenkins jobs, and how the CI-CD chain is build-up. Kafka was used as message queue between several created Dockerized micro services written in Python that were spread out over the Volvo network. I designed the system from a conceptional idea to a production ready implementation. The project is used by the verification department of the Connectivity Group.
\SmallSep

\textbf{DevOps Engineer:} Created and maintained several CI-CD freestyle Jenkins jobs (Python) as part of the CI team responsible for the telematics gateway.
\SmallSep

\textbf{Data logging system:} Prototyped and developed (C++) a data logging system for autonomous and concept vehicles. Including hardware selection, embedded software, design of an on- and offboard QUI, data storage, as well as remote controlling of the logging unit. 
\SmallSep

\textbf{Scrum master:} Scrum master on the agile release train that created the first commercial autonomous transportation solution.
\SmallSep

\textbf{Communication infrastructure to enable autonomous driving:} Investigating the requirements, selection of Hardware and technologies, as well as on-site measurements. Later on I became the element owner of the wireless communication infrastructure at the project's customer.  
\SmallSep

\textbf{Research projects:} Software Developer (C++) on public funded research projects with a focus on C-ITS. \\
